# Document Analyzer

A simple console app to learn C# by building a tiny document analyzer. Starts with word counting and can grow into keyword extraction, tagging, and simple sentiment cues.

## Requirements
- .NET 8 SDK

## Run
```bash
dotnet run
```
Then provide the path to a text file (e.g., `sample.txt`).

## Roadmap
- Clean word counting (trim empty entries)
- Keyword frequency report
- Tagging by keywords
- Optional: call an external API for sentiment

## Notes
This repo is meant as a teaching tool—keep code simple and add features incrementally.
